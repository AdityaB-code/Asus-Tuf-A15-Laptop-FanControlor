# ASUS ROG Control Center Installation on Arch Linux

This guide helps you install **ROG Control Center** on your ASUS device running Arch Linux.

## 📚 Useful Arch Wiki Link

Refer to the official Arch Wiki for ASUS devices:

🔗 [ASUS Linux - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ASUS_Linux)

This page includes valuable information on getting the **ROG Control Center** working properly.

## 🛠️ Key Points

- Check your specific model's compatibility.
- Follow any model-specific kernel module or driver instructions.
- Some features may require additional tools like `asusctl`, `supergfxctl`, or `rog-control-center` packages from the AUR.
- Use `systemd` services where applicable for startup control.

## 💡 Tip
